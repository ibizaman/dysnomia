# Activate or deactivate a process script. A process can either be a single
# executable in the bin/ sub folder, or a process specification in
# etc/dysnomia/process/*
#
# The process specification is a key=value pair configuration file that supports
# two fields. The process field refers to the process to execute, the pidFile to
# the path of the PID file that contains the PID of the daemon. If no pidFile is
# given, then it will be inferred from the process executable name.

This could mean that the initialization process is unreliable and it appears
at a later point in time. Alternatively, it may not appear all.

If the PID file does not appear, then the daemon cannot be terminated by the
deployment system! Please double check the configuration, the process' status
and increase the timeout setting, if needed.
